      Makes sure that writes on the given table are written to permanent storage.
      If you perform a write with <code>durability</code> set to <code>'soft'</code>,
      you receive no information on when the write actually gets written to permanent storage.
      A subsequent call to <code>sync</code> does not return before all previous writes to the table
      have been persisted.

    body: "$PARENT.sync()"

          After having updated multiple heroes with soft durability, We now want to wait
          until these changes have been persisted.
        code:
          js: |
            r.table('marvel').sync().run(conn, callback)
